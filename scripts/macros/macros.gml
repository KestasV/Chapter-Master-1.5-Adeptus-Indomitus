// world's outlying regions hold a modest slice and a huge world's are capped at the ceiling.
// This makes clearing an outlying region a bounded objective and leaves the bulk in the
// capital as a visible reserve. See region_garrison.
// Retained for the Imperial PDF/Guard split (region_imperial_garrison_share), whose pools

// A region can only feed so many troops into contact at once: its FRONT WIDTH. The rest of
// whoever holds it is reserve, trickling forward at the region's reinforcement rate.
// Terrain decides both, so WHERE you fight matters as much as who: an open plain is a wide
// front that reinforces fast, a mountain pass is a narrow one that starves. Each region
// also carries a persistent random modifier so no two of the same terrain read alike.
//
// This governs the ENEMY only. The chapter never fields more than a few hundred bodies, so
// a width that could bind it would have to be small enough to throttle the enemy into
// triviality; the drop select shows the player their own number against the line for
// information instead. (Guard auxilia are the one player-side force numerous enough to be
// worth binding later, once their headcounts are settled.)
//
// The width is a TARGET, not just a ceiling: the spawn tables size an army from the world's
// strength tier, which is often far below what a region's garrison could actually put in
// the line. On wide ground against a deep garrison the engagement scales UP toward the

// Eldar craftworld hunt. The hidden craftworld and the full Eldar battle roster have
// always been in the game; what was missing is any way for Eldar to appear (nothing
// ever raised p_eldar on normal worlds) and any realistic way to find the craftworld
// (a 5% roll when parking a fleet within 300px of an invisible star). Now an Eldar
// warhost strikes an inhabited world on a random cadence between ELDAR_INTERVAL_MIN
// and ELDAR_INTERVAL_MAX turns; each ground
// victory against them yields one piece of intelligence, and at ELDAR_INTEL_REQUIRED
// pieces the craftworld is revealed for invasion. Warhost strength starts at
// FORCE_BASE and ramps by one per clue collected up to FORCE_MAX, keeping max-tier
// Eldar for the craftworld itself (its garrison is 6). ELDAR_FLEET_ENABLED gates the
// craftworld's orbiting fleet, disabled for now so the reveal never forces Eldar
// naval combat; flip to 1 to restore it. Gathered intelligence goes stale after
// ELDAR_CLUE_EXPIRY turns: the clues are lost and the craftworld slips away to a new
// hidden location, so it must be located, reached and assaulted within that window.

// run ~32-40 strong). They still deploy as one movable hireling line; this only affects firing.

// Imperial Guard accuracy ("doom"): mirrors the enemy's per-faction doom in scr_shoot (the

// conscripts connects far less than disciplined Astartes fire, so the guard's ranged lasgun
// volleys have their effective shots scaled by this fraction before damage. The player branch
// divides damage_per_weapon by wep_num rather than the scaled count, so per-shot damage is
// untouched and the cut is linear: the volley still fires in full but only this share lands.
// 1 = no reduction (marine-grade, also what Elite Cultists fire at), 0.35 = roughly a third of
// the lasguns connect. Kills scale about linearly with this value, so 0.7 is roughly double the
// effectiveness of 0.35 with no change to damage or penetration.
